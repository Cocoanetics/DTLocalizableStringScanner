DTLocalizableStringScanner
==========================

This project aims to duplicate and enhance the functionality found in the `genstrings` utility provided by Apple. The Demo builds a command line utility `genstrings2` which works like the original but using more modern techniques. The Core contains classes and categories to add this scanning functionality to [Linguan](http://www.cocoanetics.com/apps/linguan/).
